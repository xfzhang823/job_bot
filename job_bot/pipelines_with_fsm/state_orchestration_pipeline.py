"""
state_orchestration_pipeline.py

This module serves as the central orchestrator for managing job postings pipeline state
progression using a Finite State Machine (FSM). It coordinates initialization,
state transitions, FSM integrity checks, and pipeline state control, ensuring that each
job posting URL is accurately tracked and progresses smoothly through each defined stage.

---

üõ†Ô∏è Core Responsibilities:

1. **Pipeline State Initialization:**
   - Initializes FSM states for new URLs, setting default stages and metadata.
   - Ensures each job URL is prepared for FSM-driven progression.

2. **FSM Integrity Checks:**
   - Regularly validates FSM state transitions and detects potential inconsistencies.
   - Ensures that the state of each job URL strictly adheres to allowed FSM transitions.

3. **FSM State Control and Management:**
   - Provides centralized control for state updates, bulk operations, and explicit
     FSM stepping.
   - Enables batch updates of statuses and FSM stages, simplifying administration.

4. **High-Level FSM Orchestration:**
   - Coordinates overall pipeline stage execution based on FSM state.
   - Interfaces with existing pipeline execution logic (`run_pipeline.py`,
   `pipeline_fsm_manager.py`).

---

üîÑ High-Level Process Flow:

```
1. Initialize URLs:
   - Gather URLs to process.
   - Initialize FSM states via `fsm_state_control.py`.

2. Run Integrity Checks:
   - Validate FSM transitions and consistency via `fsm_integrity_checker.py`.
   - Address any flagged issues before proceeding.

3. Trigger FSM-based Pipeline Execution:
   - Query current FSM states from DuckDB (`pipeline_control` table).
   - Identify URLs eligible for each pipeline stage (e.g., job_postings,
   extracted_requirements).
   - Execute respective pipeline modules based on FSM stage/status.

4. FSM State Advancement:
   - Upon successful completion of each stage for each URL, explicitly advance 
   FSM states.
   - Persist FSM updates into DuckDB to ensure accurate tracking.

5. Repeat Process:
   - Regularly run FSM integrity checks between stages.
   - Continuously update, manage, and progress URLs through pipeline stages.
```

üì¶ Module Usage:

```python
# Typical usage from main orchestrator
from fsm.fsm_integrity_checker import validate_fsm_integrity
from fsm.fsm_state_control import FSMStateControl

class StateOrchestrator:

    def __init__(self):
        self.control = FSMStateControl()

    def initialize_pipeline(self, urls: list[str]):
        self.control.initialize_urls(urls)
        validate_fsm_integrity()

    def execute_pipeline_stages(self):
        # Call appropriate pipeline execution functions based on FSM stage
        pass  # logic to query FSM and execute pipeline stages

    def advance_states(self, urls: list[str]):
        for url in urls:
            self.control.step_fsm(url)

# Run orchestration
orchestrator = StateOrchestrator()
orchestrator.initialize_pipeline(["https://job1.com", "https://job2.com"])
orchestrator.execute_pipeline_stages()
```

---

üö© Scalability and Future Extensions:

- **LLM-Based FSM Routing (`llm_fsm.py`):**
  - Integrate an optional LLM-based decision engine to dynamically decide FSM transitions
    based on content, state, or analytics.

- **Automated Integrity Checking:**
  - Set up periodic integrity checks as cron jobs or background processes.

- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Extend analytics (`fsm_analytics.py`) to visualize FSM progression, detect bottlenecks,
    and enhance operational insights.

---

‚öôÔ∏è Integration Points with Existing Modules:

- `pipeline_fsm_manager.py`: Detailed FSM transition logic per URL.
- `run_pipeline.py`: General-purpose pipeline execution logic.
- `db_io`: FSM state persistence (DuckDB).
- `models`: FSM state validation (Pydantic).

---

üìå Module Dependencies:

- **Internal:**
  - `fsm.fsm_integrity_checker`
  - `fsm.fsm_state_control`
  - `fsm.pipeline_fsm_manager`
  - `db_io.state_sync`
  - `db_io.schema_definitions`

- **External:**
  - `DuckDB` (state persistence)
  - `Pydantic` (state validation)

This structured and FSM-centric orchestration ensures robust, transparent, 
and scalable pipeline execution, laying a clear foundation for future 
enhancements like LLM-driven state management.
