"""
fsm/pipeline_fsm_manager.py

Provides a high-level interface for loading, inspecting, and advancing
pipeline FSM states stored in the DuckDB `pipeline_control` table.

This manager encapsulates:
- Fetching the latest active `PipelineState` row for a given URL.
- Validating and converting DuckDB rows into Pydantic `PipelineState` models.
- Constructing `PipelineFSM` instances for state-transition logic.
- Querying the current stage without manual SQL.

    PipelineFSMManager

    A utility wrapper for managing and interacting with the `pipeline_control` table
    in DuckDB. Responsibilities include:

      - Retrieving the most recent active `PipelineState` for a job URL.
      - Converting raw DuckDB rows into validated Pydantic models.
      - Constructing and returning `PipelineFSM` instances.
      - Exposing helper methods for querying current stage or stepping the FSM.

    This class does NOT itself implement the FSM transitions â€” it delegates
    that to `PipelineFSM`, which enforces valid stage steps and persistence.
