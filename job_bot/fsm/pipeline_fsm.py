Finite State Machine (FSM) for managing pipeline stage progression.

This module implements a state machine to control sequential advancement through
a predefined pipeline workflow.

Key features:

1. Linear Stage Progression:
   - Defined stages: JOB_URLS → JOB_POSTINGS → ... → FINAL_RESPONSIBILITIES
   - Strictly sequential transitions via 'advance' trigger
   - Automatic persistence to DuckDB after each transition

2. Core Components:
   - PipelineFSM: Main controller class wrapping transitions.Machine
   - State tracking via PipelineState Pydantic model
   - Automatic timestamping of state changes

3. Key Operations:
   - step(): Advance to next stage and persist
   - get_current_stage(): Check current position
   - get_next_stage(): Preview upcoming stage

Usage:
    state = PipelineState(url="...")
    fsm = PipelineFSM(state)
    fsm.step()  # Advances pipeline and saves state

class PipelineFSM:
    """
    A finite state machine (FSM) controller for managing job progress through
    atomic pipeline stages.

    This controller wraps a `PipelineState` model and tracks a job's current
    `stage` and `status`, providing stepwise advancement through a linear sequence
    of well-defined stages
    (e.g., job_urls → job_postings → extracted_requirements → … → final_export).

    After each successful transition, the FSM updates the associated
    `PipelineState` record and persists it to the DuckDB `pipeline_control` table.

    ---
    Workflow:
        1. Initialize with a `PipelineState` object (defaults to the first stage
           if unset).
        2. Call `.step()` to advance from the current stage to the next defined stage.
        3. After advancing, the `PipelineState` is updated with the new stage,
           status, and `updated_at` timestamp.
        4. FSM persists the state via the upsert helper
           (`update_and_persist_pipeline_state`).
        5. If the job is already at the final stage, the FSM does not advance further.

    ---
    Class-level Constants:
        STAGES (list[PipelineStage]): Ordered list of atomic pipeline stages.
        TRANSITIONS (list[dict]): Advance transitions between each stage
        (used by the FSM engine).

    ---
    Instance Fields:
        state_model (PipelineState): Pydantic model containing job metadata and
            pipeline tracking info.
        _state (PipelineStage): Internal tracker of the FSM's current stage
            (mirrors `state_model.stage`).
        _status (PipelineStatus): Internal tracker of the FSM's current status
            (mirrors `state_model.status`).

    ---
    Key Methods:
        step(): Advance to the next stage and persist updated state.
        get_current_stage(): Returns the current stage (enum).
        get_next_stage(): Returns the next stage based on the transition map.
        mark_status(): Set a new status and persist the change.

    ---
    Example:
        >>> fsm = PipelineFSM(state)
        >>> fsm.step()  # Moves from current stage to the next one and updates DuckDB
        >>> fsm.mark_status(PipelineStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
        ...                 notes="Requirements parsed and stored.")
