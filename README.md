# Pipeline Management Overview

In this project, pipelines are defined, managed, and executed in a modular fashion. The main components responsible for managing the pipelines include the following files:

1. **pipeline_config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the pipelines, such as input/output paths, parameters, and model specifications. This file organizes the pipeline logic and prepares it for execution.
   
2. **pipeline_manager.py**: The core logic for managing the execution of different pipeline steps. It manages loading configurations, initializing components, and orchestrating the pipeline's flow.
   
3. **run_pipelines.py**: This file handles the orchestration of the pipeline execution. It provides functionality to trigger specific pipelines, execute them in sequence, and handle any necessary cleanup or logging.

4. **main.py**: The entry point for running the entire pipeline. It imports the necessary components and starts the pipeline execution, passing configurations and managing the flow.

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Run Pipelines

### 1. **Set Up Environment**
   Before running the pipeline, ensure that all required dependencies are installed. These dependencies are typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file or can be identified through the `import` statements in the code.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. **Configure Pipeline Settings**
   The pipeline configuration file (`pipeline_config.py`) contains key parameters for pipeline execution, such as input directories, output paths, and specific settings for each pipeline step. Review and modify this file if necessary.

   - Ensure paths for input/output are correct.
   - Set model configurations or other parameters needed by your pipeline steps.

### 3. **Understand the Pipeline Steps**
   The pipelines in the project are divided into various steps. Each step performs a specific task, such as data processing, transformation, or model inference. These steps are orchestrated in `pipeline_manager.py` and executed in sequence in `run_pipelines.py`.

   The pipeline steps include:
   - **Pre-processing**: Prepare data or configuration.
   - **Execution**: Run the model or task.
   - **Post-processing**: Handle results, e.g., saving them to a file.

### 4. **Run the Pipelines**

   You can run the pipeline from the `main.py` file. This file imports all the components necessary to start the pipeline and triggers the execution process.

   To run the pipeline, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will:
   - Initialize the pipeline manager.
   - Load configuration settings from `pipeline_config.py`.
   - Orchestrate the execution of the steps defined in `run_pipelines.py`.

   You can also modify `main.py` to run specific pipelines or adjust the parameters passed to the pipeline manager.

### 5. **Check the Output**
   After running the pipeline, check the output in the directories specified in the configuration. The results may include processed data, model outputs, or logs. These results can be used for further analysis or model evaluation.

## Notes
- The project is modular and allows for easy adjustments to the pipeline configuration and execution flow.
- If you want to execute only a specific part of the pipeline, you can modify `run_pipelines.py` to focus on individual steps or use flags in `main.py`.
