Extract key information and relevant content from the provided job description, converting it into a comprehensive, valid JSON format. Exclude purely website-related information or general company boilerplate not specific to the job.

Instructions:
1. Identify and extract the following key details if present:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Salary information
   - Posted date (if available)
2. Capture the job-specific content, preserving its structure as much as possible.
3. Use clear section headers as keys in the JSON structure when present.
4. For content without clear section headers, use general keys like "description" or "additional_info".
5. Exclude information that is:
   - Purely related to website navigation or functionality
   - Generic company information not specific to the job role
   - Legal disclaimers or privacy policies unrelated to the job
   - Repetitive footer information

Content to process: {content}

Output structure:
{{
  "job_title": "<string or null if not found>",
  "company": "<string or null if not found>",
  "location": "<string or null if not found>",
  "salary_info": "<string or null if not found>",
  "posted_date": "<string or null if not found>",
  "content": {{
    "<section_name>": "<full text of relevant section>",
    "<another_section>": "<full text of relevant section>",
    "description": "<any relevant content without a clear section header>",
    "additional_info": "<any remaining relevant content>"
  }}
}}

JSON Formatting Instructions:
1. Use "null" (without quotes) for any key details not found in the content.
2. Preserve newlines within string values using \\n.
3. Escape any double quotes within string values.
4. Ensure the output is a valid JSON object.

Extract all job-relevant information, but exclude website-specific content and generic company information not directly related to the job posting.

    "   - 'cultural_fit': Attributes related to company culture, values, or soft skills that indicate a good match with the organization's environment and ethos (e.g., 'Strong team player,' 'Committed to diversity and inclusion').\n"

You are a skilled professional at writing resumes. Please perform the following tasks:
1. Optimize the candidate text to increase semantic precision and similarity with the reference text.
2. Reduce the semantic distance between the candidate text and reference text.
3. Enhance entailment relationships, where the candidate text serves as the premise and the reference text serves as the hypothesis.
4. For the entailment task, the candidate text serves as the premise and the reference text serves as the hypothesis, reversing their typical roles.
5. Improve the overall alignment and relevance between the two texts, without compromising their directional relationship.
6. Do not copy specific experience durations directly from the reference text (e.g., "11 years experience in...", "more than 10 years in...", "8 years experience"). Instead, express relevant experience in more general terms or use ranges that encompass the candidate's actual experience.
