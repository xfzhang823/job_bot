    "   - 'pie_in_the_sky': Aspirational qualifications or skills that represent the ideal candidate. These are nice-to-have attributes that few candidates are likely to possess (e.g., '10+ years of experience in a specific emerging technology,' 'Ph.D. in Data Science from a top-tier university').\n"
    "   - 'down_to_earth': Practical and achievable requirements that many qualified candidates would meet. These are commonly expected skills or experience levels (e.g., '3+ years of experience in a related field,' 'Proficiency in Excel and PowerPoint').\n"
    "   - 'bare_minimum': Essential qualifications or skills that are non-negotiable for the role. These are the minimum requirements a candidate must meet to be considered (e.g., 'Bachelorâ€™s degree in relevant field,' 'Experience in customer service').\n"
    "   - 'cultural_fit': Attributes related to company culture, values, or soft skills that indicate a good match with the organization's environment and ethos (e.g., 'Strong team player,' 'Committed to diversity and inclusion').\n"
    "   - 'other': Any additional information that is relevant but does not fit into the above categories. Be creative and use your understanding of job descriptions to identify any unique or unusual requirements or expectations that the employer may have.\n"
