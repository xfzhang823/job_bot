You are a skilled professional at analyzing job descriptions. Extract key information and relevant content \
from the provided job description, converting it into a comprehensive, valid JSON format. \
Exclude purely website-related information or general company boilerplate not specific to the job.

Instructions:
1. Identify and extract the following key details if present:
   - url
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Salary information
   - Posted date (if available)
2. Capture the job-specific content, preserving its structure as much as possible.
3. Use clear section headers as keys in the JSON structure when present.
4. For content without clear section headers, use general keys like "description" or "additional_info".
5. Exclude information that is:
   - Purely related to website navigation or functionality
   - Generic company information not specific to the job role
   - Legal disclaimers or privacy policies unrelated to the job
   - Repetitive footer information

Content to process: {content}

Output structure:
{{
  "url": "<string or null if not found>",
  "job_title": "<string or null if not found>",
  "company": "<string or null if not found>",

JSON Formatting Instructions:
1. Use "null" (without quotes) for any key details not found in the content.
2. Preserve newlines within string values using \\n.
3. Escape any double quotes within string values.
4. Ensure the output is a valid JSON object.

Extract all job-relevant information, but exclude website-specific content and generic company information not directly related to the job posting.

EXTRACT_JOB_REQUIREMENTS_PROMPT = """
You are a job description analysis expert. Extract and organize **explicit** and **implied** job requirements \
from the following job description. Group similar responsibilities into concise themes to avoid excessive bullets.

### **Instructions:**
1Ô∏è. **Extract Key Employer Expectations**  
   - Identify requirements from sections like 'Qualifications,' 'Requirements,' 'Responsibilities,' 'Skills,' 'Experience,' 'What Will You Do' and similar.  
   - Include both **explicit** qualifications (stated clearly) and **implied** qualifications (inferred from responsibilities).  
   - Summarize responsibilities into **high-level themes** rather than listing every detail.

2Ô∏è. **Categorize into Five Tiers:**  
   - **pie_in_the_sky**: Ambitious, high-level expectations (e.g., "Led multi-billion dollar transformations").  
   - **down_to_earth**: Practical, commonly expected qualifications (e.g., "5+ years of business development experience").  
   - **bare_minimum**: Essential, non-negotiable requirements (e.g., "Bachelor‚Äôs degree in marketing").  
   - **cultural_fit**: Soft skills, values, and leadership qualities (e.g., "Collaborative, growth-oriented mindset").  
   - **other**: Specific tools, certifications, or unique qualifications (e.g., "Expertise in Salesforce CRM").

3Ô∏è. **Group Responsibilities into Concise, Meaningful Insights If Possible**  
   - Instead of listing **every** responsibility separately, **group similar responsibilities** into **high-level summaries**.  
   - Example:
     ‚úÖ "Develop and execute enterprise sales strategies, manage key client relationships, and drive revenue growth."`
     ‚ùå "Develop enterprise sales strategies."`, `"Manage client relationships."`, `"Drive revenue growth."` *(Too granular!)*  

4Ô∏è. **Limit Output Size**  
   - ‚ö° **Maximum 5-7 key points per category** (Choose the most representative ones).
   - üöÄ **Avoid redundancy** (Don't repeat qualifications across categories).
