fsm/pipeline_fsm.py

Finite State Machine (FSM) for managing pipeline stage progression.

This module implements a state machine to control sequential advancement through
a predefined pipeline workflow. Key features:

1. Linear Stage Progression:
   - Defined stages: JOB_URLS ‚Üí JOB_POSTINGS ‚Üí ... ‚Üí FINAL_RESPONSIBILITIES
   - Strictly sequential transitions via 'advance' trigger
   - Automatic persistence to DuckDB after each transition

2. Core Components:
   - PipelineFSM: Main controller class wrapping transitions.Machine
   - State tracking via PipelineState Pydantic model
   - Automatic timestamping of state changes

3. Key Operations:
   - step(): Advance to next stage and persist
   - get_current_stage(): Check current position
   - get_next_stage(): Preview upcoming stage

Usage:
    state = PipelineState(url="...")
    fsm = PipelineFSM(state)
    fsm.step()  # Advances pipeline and saves state

def get_transitions(stages: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Generate linear transition mappings for an ordered list of pipeline stages.

    Each transition moves from one stage to the next in sequence using the trigger 'advance',
    suitable for use with the `transitions` state machine library.

    * Note: {"trigger": "advance", "source": "editing", "dest": "revaluation"} are
    * standard parameters recognized by the transitions library.

    Example:
        Given stages = ["job_urls", "job_postings", "extracted_requirements"],
        the returned transitions will be:
            [

class PipelineFSM:
    """
    A finite state machine (FSM) controller for managing job progress through
    atomic pipeline stages.

    This controller wraps a `PipelineState` model and tracks a job's current stage,
    providing stepwise advancement through a linear sequence of well-defined stages
    (e.g., job_urls ‚Üí job_postings ‚Üí extracted_requirements ‚Üí ... ‚Üí final_export).

    After each successful transition, the FSM updates the associated `PipelineState` record
    and persists it to the DuckDB `pipeline_control` table.

    ---
    * Workflow:
        1. Initialize with a `PipelineState` object (defaults to the first stage if unset).
        2. Call `.step()` to advance from the current stage to the next defined stage.
        3. After advancing, the `PipelineState` is updated with the new stage and timestamp.
        4. FSM persists the state to DuckDB using `save_pipeline_state_to_duckdb`.
        5. If the job is already at the final stage, the FSM does not advance further.

    ---
    Class-level Constants:
        STAGES (list[str]): Ordered list of atomic pipeline stages.
        TRANSITIONS (list[dict]): Advance transitions between each stage
        (used by `transitions` Machine).

    ---
    Instance Fields:
        state_model (PipelineState): Pydantic model containing job metadata and
        pipeline tracking info.
        _state (str): Internal tracker of the FSM's current stage
        (mirrors state_model.last_stage).

    ---
    Key Methods:
        step(): Advance to the next stage and persist updated state.
        get_current_stage(): Returns the current stage from state_model or internal state.
        get_next_stage(): Returns the next stage based on the defined transition map.

    ---
    Example:
    >>>    fsm = PipelineFSM(state)
    >>>    fsm.step()  # Moves from current stage to the next one and updates DuckDB
    >>>    fsm.mark_status(PipelineStatus.IN_PROGRESS, notes="Requirements parsed and stored.")
